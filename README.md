Summary: It would be important to stress to investors that 81% of riders in New York City during August 2019 are paid subscribers which suggests that starting a bikeshare business in Des Moines does seem like a solid business proposal. When beginning a bikeshare business in Des Moines, it would be a good idea to begin marketing to males since most riders in New York City were male and they were also more likely to become subscribers. It would also be useful to give promotional offers for 10 minute rides during Thursdays at 7:30am to 8:30am, as well as Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays at 4:30pm to 6:30pm since these were the most popular times for people to use bikeshare in New York City. 

Some recommendations would be to create visualizations that focus on determining which locations would be best to provide bikeshare services. One visualization could determine which bikestations were most popular and why (were these stations located in popular tourist locations which are close to parks or landmarks, were they close to bus stations etc.) Another visualization could focus on where most riders ended their trips relative to that bikestation. This would be useful in determining where to set-up the bikeshare stations in Des Moines.
