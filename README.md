# bikesharing

Background:
Last summer I visited New York City with my friend Kate. We used the bikesharing platform Citibike to visit many historic landmarks and interact better with the city and people who lived there. Kate and I are now discussing starting up a similar bikeshare business in our hometown of Des Moines, Ioha. Kate has an angel investor who is interested in providing seat funding to explore a bikeshare program in Des Moines.

Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to understand how a bikeshare business works in New York City and how it may work in Des Moines. My task it to figure out how opening a bikeshare program in Des Moines may work and to convince investors that this is a solid business proposal.

Description of Results:
- During August 2019 in New York City, the total number of riders was 2 344 224, and a majority were subsribers (1 900 359).
- A signifcant majority of riders were male
- All bike rides were under an hour long and the majority of rides were only 5 minutes
- Most male riders biked for 5 minutes most female riders biked for 7 minutes
- The most popular times to ride is 4:30pm to 6:30pm on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, as well as 7:30am to 8:30am on Thursdays
- There are more male subscribers than female subscribers
- Male riders on Thursdays are often subscribers

Summary: It would be important to stress to investors that 81% of riders in New York City during August 2019 are paid subscribers and so starting a bikeshare business does seem like a solid business proposal. When beginning a bikeshare business in Des Moines, it would be a good idea to begin marketing to males since most riders in New York City were male and they were also likely to become subscribers. It would also be useful to give promotional offers for 10 minute rides during Thursdays at 7:30am to 8:30am, as well as Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays at 4:30pm to 6:30pm since these were the most popular times for people to use bikeshare in New York City. 

Some recommendations would be to create visualization that focus on determining which locations would be best to provide bikeshare services at. One visualization could determine which bikestations were most popular and why (were these stations located in popular tourist locations which are close to parks or landmarks, were they close to bus stations etc.) Another visualization could focus on where most riders ended their trips relative to that bikestation. This would be useful in determining where to set-up the bikeshare stations in Des Moines.
